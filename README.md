Library Management System

This C++ program simulates a basic Library Management System. It allows users to add books, display the list of books in the library, and remove books based on their ID.

# Features

1. Add Book: Users can add a new book to the library by providing the book's title and author's name.

2. Display Books: Users can view a list of all books present in the library, along with their IDs, titles, and authors.

3. Remove Book: Users can remove a book from the library by entering the book's ID.

# Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu showing various options.

Enter the desired option number and follow the prompts to perform actions such as adding books, displaying books, removing books, or exiting the program.

1) For adding a book, enter the book's title and author's name.

2) For removing a book, enter the ID of the book you want to remove.

3) To exit the program, choose the "Exit" option from the menu.

# Note

The program uses the vector container to store and manage books.
Books are uniquely identified by their IDs, which are assigned sequentially as books are added.
The program handles invalid input by checking for invalid integers and clearing the input stream.
